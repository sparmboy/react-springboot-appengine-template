# api
A swaggar blue print that produces typescript DTOs and client library together with Java DTOs and a Spring boot server from a single swaggar definition

# Usage
* Modify the [swaggar.json](src/main/resources/swaggar.json) and associated schemas for your API definition
* Build with
```batch
mvn clean install
```

This will generate the typescript and java libraries ready to use in your project.

Good luck. We're all counting on you...
